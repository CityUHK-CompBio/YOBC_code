# Dissecting breast cancer subtype-dependent aging acceleration and development of molecular and histology image-based aging clocks for the prediction of high-risk young-onset patients   

## 1. Background   
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy, causing millions of deaths worldwide. Significantly, the incidence rate of young-onset BC patients increased drastically over the last decade, and the young-onset BC patients were associated with higher recurrence rates and more advanced stages when diagnosed. However, the hidden mechanism driving the aggressiveness of young-onset BC patients is largely unknown.
